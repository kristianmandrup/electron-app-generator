# electron-app-generator

Electron app to generate/upgrade an app or project. 

Use this instead of typical CLI generator such as:
- yeoman
- slush
- ...

This project seeks to take the best elements of Plop and other more flexible, lightweight generators 
while providing a much better UI/UX experience for setting up the dev environment for your project.   

## Build Setup

``` bash
# install dependencies
npm install

# serve with hot reload at localhost:9080
npm run dev

# build electron app for production
npm run build

# lint all JS/Vue component files in `app/src`
npm run lint

# run webpack in production
npm run pack
```
